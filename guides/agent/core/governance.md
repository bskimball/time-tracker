# Agent Governance

## Expected working style

- Start at [../README.md](../README.md), then read only task-relevant guides.
- Prefer small, targeted changes with validation (`lint`/`typecheck`) after meaningful edits.
- If guidance is missing or unclear, update/add a focused guide and link it from [../README.md](../README.md).

## Subagent expectations

- Subagents follow parent-task direction plus `AGENTS.md`.
- End with a concise summary that includes:
  - What changed
  - Why it changed
