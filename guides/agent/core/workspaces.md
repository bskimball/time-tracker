# Workspaces

- `apps/web` — main application (React Router + RSC Data mode)
- `apps/marketing` — marketing site (Astro)
- `apps/docs` — customer docs site (Astro Starlight)
- `packages/design-system` — shared UI components and design tokens

Use task-scoped docs in [../README.md](../README.md) to choose the right guide before changing a workspace.
