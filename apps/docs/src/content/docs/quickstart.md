title: Deployment Quickstart
description: Start using Time Tracker in hosted or on-premise environments.
---

## Choose your deployment model

- **Hosted**: Fastest onboarding; infrastructure is managed for you.
- **On-premise**: Run Time Tracker inside your own network and infrastructure.

## Hosted quickstart

1. Request an organization account.
2. Sign in as an administrator and open **System Settings**.
3. Configure stations, employees, users, API keys, and operational config.
4. Validate floor clock-in flows on `/floor` or `/floor/kiosk`.

## On-premise quickstart

1. Provision your environment (compute, networking, and PostgreSQL).
2. Deploy the web application and API services.
3. Configure environment variables, authentication, and TLS.
4. Validate application access and API health checks.

## Validate core workflows

- User sign-in and role access
- Employee time clock, task controls, and break tracking
- Manager floor monitoring, timesheet corrections, and reports
- Administrator setup for users, API keys, and KPI thresholds
- API authentication and OpenAPI documentation access

## Next steps

- Review [Navigation and Access](/web-app/navigation-and-access).
- Review [Employee Guide](/web-app/employee), [Manager Guide](/web-app/manager), and [Administrator Guide](/web-app/administrator).
- Review [REST API and OpenAPI](/api/rest-openapi) for integrations.
- Keep [Troubleshooting](/web-app/troubleshooting) bookmarked for day-one rollout support.
