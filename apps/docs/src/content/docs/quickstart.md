description: Start using Time Tracker in hosted or on-premise environments.
---

## Choose your deployment model

- **Hosted**: Fastest onboarding; infrastructure is managed for you.
- **On-premise**: Run Time Tracker inside your own network and infrastructure.

## Hosted quickstart

1. Request an organization account.
2. Configure your users, locations, and work policies.
3. Share user invitations and verify employee clock-in flows.

## On-premise quickstart

1. Provision your environment (compute, networking, and PostgreSQL).
2. Deploy the web application and API services.
3. Configure environment variables, authentication, and TLS.
4. Validate application access and API health checks.

## Validate core workflows

- User sign-in and role access
- Employee time clock and break tracking
- Manager approvals and reporting
- API authentication and sample endpoint requests

## Next steps

- Review [Web App Basics](/web-app/basics) for common tasks.
