description: Role-based overview of core workflows in the Time Tracker web app.
---

Time Tracker is organized around warehouse operations and role-specific access.

## Role-based workflow model

- **Employee (Floor)**: clock in/out, breaks, and active task controls.
- **Manager (Portal)**: monitor floor activity, manage timesheets, run reports, and coordinate assignments.
- **Administrator (Settings + Executive)**: configure system behavior, access, and integration settings.

## Core navigation areas

- `/floor` and `/floor/kiosk`: employee-first clock workflows.
- `/manager`: operational management hub.
- `/settings`: administration and configuration.
- `/executive`: strategic KPI and analytics views.

## Design language in-product

- Precision Industrial UI patterns emphasize dense information, clear hierarchy, and high-signal status indicators.
- Core interactions use compact cards, tabular values, hard borders, and quick action controls.
